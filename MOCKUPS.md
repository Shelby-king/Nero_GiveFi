# GiveFi Mockups
I’m stoked to show you what **GiveFi** will look like! For Wave 1, I’m sharing a quick vision of the UI to make micro-charity feel as easy as your favorite app. Picture a colorful, heartwarming design that invites everyone to donate, earn NFTs, and have fun—all gas-free thanks to NERO’s Paymaster. Below are descriptions of the main screens, with sketches in the `images/` folder to bring it to life. This is just the start, and I’ll polish it in Wave 2!

## Homepage

- **Vibe**: Warm and welcoming, like a community rally for good causes.  
- **Features**: Big “Donate Now” button, campaign cards (e.g., “Books for Kids: $50/$100”), and a mini-leaderboard (“Top Giver: Sarah”). Orange/purple gradients and a heart logo.  
- **Why It Works**: Inspires users to jump in, no crypto confusion.  
- **Visual**: Check out `images/homepage.png` for a sketch!

## Donation Screen

- **Vibe**: Clean and focused, like sending a quick payment.  
- **Features**: Campaign photo, progress bar, and donation buttons (10¢, 50¢, custom). A “Gas-Free!” badge highlights Paymaster.  
- **Why It Works**: Makes donating a one-tap breeze for non-crypto folks.  
- **Visual**: See `images/donation_screen.png` (planned, or imagine a simple form).

## Leaderboard & Quests

- **Vibe**: Playful and gamified, with trophies and quest cards.  
- **Features**: Leaderboard (“#1: Ahmed, 100 Points”) and quests (“Fund 10 Books: 3/10”). Share-to-X button for bonus points.  
- **Why It Works**: Keeps users hooked with competition and fun.  
- **Visual**: Coming in Wave 2, or picture a leaderboard with shiny badges.

## Why This UI Shines

- **Simple**: Big buttons, clear text—perfect for students, parents, or anyone.  
- **Inclusive**: No crypto knowledge needed, just a phone.  
- **Heartfelt**: Campaign photos and NFTs make giving personal.  
- **Paymaster Power**: Gas-free badges show NERO’s magic.

For Wave 1, these descriptions and sketches set the stage. Wave 2 will bring full mockups in Canva or Figma, plus a demo video. See `images/` for visuals, [README.md](README.md) for the big picture, [USER_FLOW.md](USER_FLOW.md) for the user journey, and [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for tech details.
